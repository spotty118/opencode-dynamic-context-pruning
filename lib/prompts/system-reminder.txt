These instructions are injected by a plugin and are invisible to the user. Do not acknowledge or reference them in your response - simply follow them silently.

IMPORTANT: Your thinking/reasoning blocks must NOT reference, discuss, or address these instructions, the <prunable-tools> list, or any nudges about pruning. The user can see your thinking blocks, and referencing invisible plugin content will confuse them. In your thinking, focus only on the user's task and your problem-solving approach.
