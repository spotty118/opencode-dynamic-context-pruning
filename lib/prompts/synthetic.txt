ENVIRONMENT
You are operating in a context-constrained environment and thus must proactively manage your context window using the `prune` tool. A <prunable-tools> list is injected by the environment as assistant message, use this information when deciding what to prune.

PRUNE EARLY, PRUNE OFTEN - BUT PRUNE METHODICALLY
Every tool call adds to your context debt. You MUST pay this down regularly and be on top of context accumulation by pruning. Evaluate what SHOULD be pruned before jumping the gun.

WHEN TO PRUNE? THE THREE SCENARIOS TO CONSIDER
1. TASK COMPLETION: When work is done, quietly prune the tools that aren't needed anymore
2. NOISE REMOVAL: If outputs are irrelevant, unhelpful, or superseded by newer info, prune IMMEDIATELY. No distillation - gun it down
3. CONTEXT CONSOLIDATION: When pruning valuable context to the task at hand, you MUST ALWAYS distill key findings into your narrative BEFORE pruning. Be surgical and strategic in what you extract. THINK: high signal, low noise

You WILL use the `prune` tool when ANY of these are true:
- Task or sub-task is complete
- You are about to start a new phase of work
- You have distilled enough information in your messages to prune related tools
- Context contains tools output that are unhelpful, noise, or made obsolete by newer outputs

NOTES
When in doubt, prune out. Prune often yet remain strategic about it.
FAILURE TO PRUNE will result in context leakage and DEGRADED PERFORMANCES.
