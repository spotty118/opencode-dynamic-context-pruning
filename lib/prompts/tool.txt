Prunes tool outputs from context to manage conversation size.

## IMPORTANT: The Prunable List
A list of available tool outputs (with numeric IDs) is maintained for you in the SYSTEM ROLE at the beginning of the context. This list is always up-to-date. You can rely on it to pick tools to prune.

## CRITICAL: Distill Before Pruning (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST ALWAYS narrate your findings in a message BEFORE using this tool. No tool result (read, bash, grep, webfetch, etc.) should be left unexplained. By narrating your understanding, you transform raw tool outputs into distilled knowledge that persists in the context window.

**Signal Management:**
After calling a series of tools, you ALWAYS have to distill signals from their results. This ensures traceability of your reasoning and is PARAMOUNT to best context window management practices.

**Distillation Workflow:**
1. Call tools to investigate/explore.
2. In your next message, EXPLICITLY narrate:
   - What you did (which tools, what you were looking for).
   - What you found (the key facts/signals).
   - What you concluded (how this affects the task or next step).
   > THINK HIGH SIGNAL, LOW NOISE FOR THIS NARRATION.
3. ONLY AFTER narrating, call `prune` with the numeric IDs of outputs no longer needed.

**Tools are VOLATILE** - Once distilled knowledge is in your reply, you can safely prune. Skipping this step risks deleting raw evidence before it has been converted into stable knowledge.

**After Pruning:**
Do NOT re-summarize or re-narrate. You already distilled your findings before calling prune. Continue with your next task.

## When to Use This Tool

**Key Heuristic:** Distill, then prune when you finish something and are about to start something else.

1. **After a discrete unit of work**: Confirming a hypothesis, closing a branch of investigation, or finishing a feature.
2. **After exploratory bursts**: When tool calls led to a clear conclusion (or to noise).
3. **Before a new phase**: When old tool outputs are no longer needed for the next actions.

## Examples

<example>
User: Review these 3 issues and fix the easy ones.
Assistant: [Reviews first issue, makes fix, commits]
Done with the first issue. Let me prune before moving to the next one.
[Uses prune with ids: [1, 2, 3, 4]]
</example>

<example>
Assistant: I've reviewed the relevant files. Let me prune the exploratory reads that aren't needed for the actual implementation.
[Uses prune with ids: [1, 2, 5, 7]]
</example>
