Prunes tool outputs from context to manage conversation size.
Refer to the <prunable-tools> list for available IDs.

WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
- After you complete a discrete unit of work (e.g. confirming a hypothesis, or closing out one branch of investigation).
- After exploratory bursts of tool calls that led you to a clear conclusion (or to noise).
- Before starting a new phase of work where old tool outputs are no longer needed to inform your next actions.

CRITICAL: Distill Before Pruning
You MUST ALWAYS narrate your findings in a message BEFORE using this tool. No tool result should be left unexplained. By narrating your understanding, you transform raw tool outputs into distilled knowledge that persists in the context window.

Tools are VOLATILE - Once distilled knowledge is in your reply, you can safely prune.

Example Workflow:
1. Investigate with tools.
2. Explicitly narrate findings (High Signal, Low Noise).
3. Call `prune` with relevant IDs.
